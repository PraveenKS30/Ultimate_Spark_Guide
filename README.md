#### Summary :

`1. RDD consists of partitions` </br>
`2. Partition is an atomic unit of parallelism.`</br>
`3. RDD may have narrow or wide dependencies.` </br>
`4. Narrow dependencies can be pipelined.`</br>
`5. Wide dependencies cause shuffles, which creates new stages.`</br>
`6. Shuffles are expensive.`
